How much does it really cost to play this game with a full set of cards?

An unfortunate soul told me about this anime-themed game that he plays, and I quickly tasked myself with looking up rarity stats and set specs in order to compute an average cost of acquiring all the cards by buying packs, by buying in-game currency.

This is a Python script that can run various simulations many times in order to return an expected value of completing a particular set at 3x copies, including the crafting mechanic for the most accurate pricing.

Results:  
Base Set ~= $640  
Expansion Set ~= $400 per set (there are currently 2 as of writing this)  

The login bonus plus in-game quest grinding only doles out about 2-3 packs per day, but you need hundreds in order to complete a set at 3x copies.

Woe to anyone who plays this game and doesn't have 1500 bucks lying around, I guess. $1900 at next expansion.
